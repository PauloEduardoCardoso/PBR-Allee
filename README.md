# PBR-Allee

This repository serves as a supplment to the (insert paper name here) paper published in (insert journal name here). In the [Data folder][https://github.com/haiderstats/PBR-Allee/tree/master/Data] can be found the data used to generate Figure X,Y, and Z (The 100 year performance, 20 year performance, and the carrying capacity performance respectively). 

The generation of the data happens in the [DataGenerationFiles folder][https://github.com/haiderstats/PBR-Allee/tree/master/DataGenerationFiles] in their respective files.

The actual generation of these figures is completed in Performance-CarryingCapacityFigureGeneration.R file in  [FigureGenerationFiles folder][https://github.com/haiderstats/PBR-Allee/tree/master/FigureGenerationFiles]. In addition, the base simulations (Figure P,Q) are constructed and the figures are made in BaseSimulationsAndFigureGeneration.R. The data for table X can also be generated using PBRComparisionTable.R.

Note that all the functions used can be found in HelperFunctions.R in the [FunctionFiles folder][https://github.com/haiderstats/PBR-Allee/tree/master/FunctionFiles].
