# PBR-Allee

This repository serves as a supplment to the Incorporating Allee effects into the Potential Biological
Removal criterion paper submitted to Natural Resource Modeling. In the [Data folder](https://github.com/haiderstats/PBR-Allee/tree/master/Data) can be found the data used to generate Figure 5,6, and 7 (The 100 year performance, 20 year performance, and the carrying capacity performance respectively). 

The files for data generation can be found in [DataGenerationFiles folder](https://github.com/haiderstats/PBR-Allee/tree/master/DataGenerationFiles). The notes for each file can be found at the beginnning of each of in the comments.

Figure generation files can be found in Performance-CarryingCapacityFigureGeneration.R file in  [FigureGenerationFiles folder](https://github.com/haiderstats/PBR-Allee/tree/master/FigureGenerationFiles). 

The initial simulations (Figures 3,4) are simulated in BaseSimulationsAndFigureGeneration.R. This is also where the figures are generated.

Note that all the functions constructed can be found in HelperFunctions.R in the [FunctionFiles folder](https://github.com/haiderstats/PBR-Allee/tree/master/FunctionFiles). Explanations for each function can be found in the commetns.
